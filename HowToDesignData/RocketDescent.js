// PROBLEM A:

// You are designing a program to track a rocket's journey as it descends
// 100 kilometers to Earth. You are only interested in the descent from
// 100 kilometers to touchdown. Once the rocket has landed it is done.

// Design a data definition to represent the rocket's remaining descent.
// Call it RocketDescent.

// Distance is Natural[0,100]
// interp. track the distance between 0 and 100 kilometers

const DIST = 0
const DIST = 50
const DIST = 100

const fncForRocketDescent = (DIST) => {
  // ...DIST
}
