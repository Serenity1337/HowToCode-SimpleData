// Problem:

// As part of designing a system to keep track of student grades, you are asked to design a data definition to represent the letter grade in a course, which is one of A, B or C.

// Grade is one of: "A", "B", "C"
// interp. The letter grade in a course.

const LG1 = 'A'
const LG2 = 'B'
const LG3 = 'C'

const fcForLetterGrade = (LG) => {
  switch (LG) {
    case 'A':
      // ...
      break
    case 'B':
      // ...
      break
    case 'C':
      // ...
      break
    default:
      break
  }
}
