// Problem:
// Imagine that you are designing a program to manage ticket sales for a theatre. (Also imagine that the theatre is perfectly rectangular in shape!)

// Design a data definition to represent a seat number in a row, where each row has 32 seats. (Just the seat number, not the row number.)

// SeatNum is Natural[1,32]
// interp. seat numbers in a row, 1 to 32 are aisle seats

const SN1 = 1
const SN2 = 12
const SN32 = 32

const fnForSeatNum = (SN) => {
  // ...SN
}
